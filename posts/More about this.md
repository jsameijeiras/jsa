# This is just a test

Everything you should know is a test of a test. In a way this is about writing and seeing where it leads. I have no audience. I don't intend to build one, it's just for me, so that I can have a journal. But it's a public journal, why? To build a surface of luck. 

Why is so simple, because we are full of confusion, of stats, of graphs, of images. But we have forgotten to express ourselves with words. Without images, without imagining, without needing to reduce or use metaphores. 

The idea is to give a me a tool of journaling. 

I actually find incredible how simple it is to write in this way. 

I just put what I think, I title it, I tag it. And the document is out. 

Sometimes I will edit, sometimes I will not. 

Who cares? It's just a blog, it shouldn't be complex, it should be just words.
